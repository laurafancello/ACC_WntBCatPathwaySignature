GSEAs on Hallmarks gene sets generated on fold changes from differential expression analyses (performed using limme for microarrays or DESeq2 for RNAseq).
Differential expression analysis was performed comparing CTNNB1 mutated tumors versus CTNNB1 wt tumors (and excluding ZNRF3 altered tumors) fro Assie and TCGA) or comparing tumors with B-Catenin nuclear accumulation vs membrane localization for Heaton dataset.
